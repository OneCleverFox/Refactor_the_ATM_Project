# ATM Machine

This is a simple ATM Machine web application built with React. It allows users to make deposits and cash back transactions, updating the account balance accordingly.

## Getting Started

To run the ATM Machine web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/OneCleverFox/Refactor_the_ATM_Project.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. On the ATM Machine webpage, you will see two buttons: "Deposit" and "Cash Back".
2. Click on the "Deposit" button to make a deposit transaction, or click on the "Cash Back" button to make a cash back transaction.
3. Once you click on either button, an input field will appear where you can enter the transaction amount.
4. Enter the transaction amount in the input field.
5. Click the "Submit" button to process the transaction.
6. If the transaction is valid (not exceeding the account balance for cash back or negative amount for deposit), the account balance will be updated accordingly.
7. The updated account balance will be displayed below the buttons.

## Dependencies

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
